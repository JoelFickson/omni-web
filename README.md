### State Management, Automation & Security

1.I highly recommend a good state management solution which would reduce the amount of code written thereby reducing
code complexity and readability

2. Security is another aspect I would recommend highly. On the lower level I would prefer JWT Tokens to be signed by the
   server and sent to the user on the front-end. These tokens could be saved in a persistent storage for tracking the
   people who are signed in and the device they are logged in
3. I would set up CI/CD for this backend with extensive tests that could greatly automate this process. I love GitHub
   Actions as they can automate the process.

### Why should we solve it?

1.To avoid unwanted access to our application, we need to solve security and auth 2.Having a workflow that works would
be ideal in terms of not having to worry if things break or not

### How do you propose to solve it?

1. State - Redux ToolKit
2. Security - JWT Tokens
3. Deployment: I would host the front-end on Netlify

### What other approaches did you consider?

1. Deployment - AWS Amplify / App Engine

### What could go wrong?

1Hackers could gain access to sensitive data
